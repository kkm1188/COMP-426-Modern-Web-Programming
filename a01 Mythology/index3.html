            <p id = "seven" class="eight">Most of Achilles' stories were told in Homer's the Iliad, which told of his many escapades
                in the Trojan War. Achilles is known to be the star of the piece because of his immense rage,
                which made him a good fighter. During the first nine years of the war,  
                Achilles ravaged the country around Troy and took 12 cities.
