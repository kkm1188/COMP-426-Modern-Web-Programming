            <h1 class="two">The Death of Achilles</h1>
            <p class="two">According to legends, Achilles was killed by Paris, who was vengeful 
                after Achilles murdered his brother. Paris ambushed Achilles as he entered Troy
                and hit him in his heel with a poisoned arrow. Because this was the one part of 
                his body that was mortal, the poisoned arrow killed him. Achilles died on the spot, 
                still undefeated in battle.
